# Fake News Classifier

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Fake News Detection System** that classifies news articles as **Fake** or **Genuine**.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** with `TF-IDF` vectorization and machine learning models like:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

The dataset used is:
- `True.csv` → Genuine news
- `Fake.csv` → Fake news  

Both datasets are merged, cleaned, preprocessed, and trained using multiple ML models.
